# Angular example

This demo shows how to implement of the knowledge acquired throughout the training cycle of multiplatform application development.
I have focused the application on the knowledge acquired about the management of user access privileges to different elements (or modules as I will refer to throughout the document) of the application, the management of users ranked in different groups (called roles) and the administration by an authorized user.
No less relevant has been the application of knowledge in the design and management of relational databases and their implementation platforms. Another factor that has been taken into account has been the security of the environment of use and of the application, implementing features such as the physical blocking of the terminal, the encryption of sensitive data, or the prevention of the use of elements sensitive to the injection of automated information. (cracking or brute force attacks).

# How to run it locally

1. [Download](https://github.com/rubenarcos2/proyecto_daw/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone the [repository](https://github.com/rubenarcos2/proyecto_daw.git) to your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rubenarcos2/proyecto_daw.git
```

2. Run `npm install` inside the downloaded/cloned folder:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
