This demo shows how to implement of the knowledge acquired throughout the training cycle of web application development.
I have focused the application on the knowledge acquired on the management of user access privileges to different elements (or modules as I will refer to throughout the document) of the application, the management of hierarchical users in different groups (called roles) and the administration by an authorised user. No less relevant has been the application of knowledge in the design and management of relational databases and their implementation platforms. Another factor taken into account was the security of the environment of use (JWT) and of the application (Angular), implementing functionalities such as the encryption of sensitive data, or the prevention of the use of elements sensitive to the injection of automated information (cracking or brute force attacks).

```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build to production serve

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
